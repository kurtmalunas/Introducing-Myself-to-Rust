        <h1><b>The Rust Programming Language</b></h1>
        <h2><b>Introduction | Installation | Concepts | Project Idea | Findings | Source Code | Next</b></h2>
        <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
        <p>Rust is an open-source system level programming language for developing software that is typically written
            in other popular languages such as C or C++. Created by Mozilla Research employee Graydon Hoare to address
            issues concerning memory errors and building concurrent programs in C and C++. Some notable programs you
            could build with this language are CLI tools, web apps, network services, and embedded systems.<br><br>As a
            Java
            developer who mainly writes high-level codes, learning Rust may be a daunting task. For the time being, I
            will limit myself to using Rust in the same way that I use Java, gradually progressing to writing
            system-level code. However, There are benefits to using this language for a better coding experience, this
            includes.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Memory safety</b> – Common memory-related issues are avoided before the programme is even
                    compiled,
                    thanks to Rust’s syntax and language metaphor, as the compiler will force you to fix them before it
                    even compiles.
                    Null Pointers: Java vs. Rust
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Speed</b> – Performance is improved by Rust’s zero cost abstraction and the lack of a garbage
                    collector.
                    If you didn’t know, Java’s garbage collector creates some runtime overhead that is out of our
                    control as programmers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Concurrency</b> - By leveraging data ownership and type checking, many concurrency errors are
                    flagged by
                    the compiler rather than discovered at runtime.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sure, Java is known for many criticisms. In fact, I’ve met some people who hate it, so why should we learn
            Rust when it wouldn’t be surprising to say that other programming languages are superior to Java? Well, Java
            isn’t entirely bad, just like its rivals, it has its benefits and disadvantages. Rust, on the other, hand
            has been regarded as the most loved programming language on Stack Overflow for many years. It is safe to say
            that Rust is a great language to learn given that Stack Overflow has been the most popular exchange network
            for programmers. Why don’t we get it a try?

        <h3><b>Installation</b></h3>
        <p>This section wasn’t meant to be included, but since installing Rust on my computer took so long, I figured
            I’d share what I did.<br><br><b>Recommended Installation is by using rustup: <br> Since I’m running on
                Windows</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>I started by downloading the Rust installer in the official site.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Download Visual Studio C++ Build tools. Open and install the “Desktop development with C++” workload.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Open the Rust installer and proceed with the default installation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure that the path environment variable for all Rust Development related tools that are
                    installed to the “~/.cargo/bin” directory is available in your system’s environment variables. If
                    not,
                    manually type yours in.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For the GUI, I decided to use Visual Studio Code and installed the “rust-analyzer” extension. Now we
                    can start writing Rust!</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3><b>Concepts</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Rustup</b> - we installed rustup by official recommendation. It is a toolchain multiplexer
                    responsible for installing, managing, and presenting Rust toolchains.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Cargo</b> - it acts as the build system and package manager for Rust. It is a tool used to help
                    download and manage the libraries that our code needs. This is installed automatically by rustup.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Rustc</b>responsible for translating Rust source code to machine language.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
