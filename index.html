        <h1>Learning the Rust Programming Language</h1>
        <h2>Introduction | Installation | Concepts | Project Idea | Findings | Source Code | Next</h2>
        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>Rust is an open-source system level programming language for developing software that is typically written
            in other popular languages such as C or C++. Created by Mozilla Research employee Graydon Hoare to address
            issues concerning memory errors and building concurrent programs in C and C++. Some notable programs you
            could build with this language are CLI tools, web apps, network services, and embedded systems.<br>As a Java
            developer who mainly writes high-level codes, learning Rust may be a daunting task. For the time being, I
            will limit myself to using Rust in the same way that I use Java, gradually progressing to writing
            system-level code. However, There are benefits to using this language for a better coding experience, this
            includes.

        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Memory safety – Common memory-related issues are avoided before the programme is even compiled,
                    thanks to Rust’s syntax and language metaphor, as the compiler will force you to fix them before it
                    even compiles.

                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Speed – Performance is improved by Rust’s zero cost abstraction and the lack of a garbage collector.
                    If you didn’t know, Java’s garbage collector creates some runtime overhead that is out of our
                    control as programmers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Concurrency – By leveraging data ownership and type checking, many concurrency errors are flagged by
                    the compiler rather than discovered at runtime.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sure, Java is known for many criticisms. In fact, I’ve met some people who hate it, so why should we learn
            Rust when it wouldn’t be surprising to say that other programming languages are superior to Java? Well, Java
            isn’t entirely bad, just like its rivals, it has its benefits and disadvantages. Rust, on the other, hand
            has been regarded as the most loved programming language on Stack Overflow for many years. It is safe to say
            that Rust is a great language to learn given that Stack Overflow has been the most popular exchange network
            for programmers. Why don’t we get it a try?
