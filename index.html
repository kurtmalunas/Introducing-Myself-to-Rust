        <h1><b>The Rust Programming Language</b></h1>
        <h2><b>Introduction | Installation | Concepts | Project Idea | Findings | Source Code | Next</b></h2>
        <h3><b>Introduction</b></h3>
        <p>Rust is an open-source system level programming language for developing software that is typically written
            in other popular languages such as C or C++. Created by Mozilla Research employee Graydon Hoare to address
            issues concerning memory errors and building concurrent programs in C and C++. Some notable programs you
            could build with this language are CLI tools, web apps, network services, and embedded systems.<br><br>As a
            Java
            developer who mainly writes high-level codes, learning Rust may be a daunting task. For the time being, I
            will limit myself to using Rust in the same way that I use Java, gradually progressing to writing
            system-level code. However, There are benefits to using this language for a better coding experience, this
            includes.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Memory safety</b> - Common memory-related issues are avoided before the programme is even
                    compiled,
                    thanks to Rust's syntax and language metaphor, as the compiler will force you to fix them before it
                    even compiles.
                    Null Pointers: Java vs. Rust
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Speed</b> - Performance is improved by Rust's zero cost abstraction and the lack of a garbage
                    collector.
                    If you didn't know, Java's garbage collector creates some runtime overhead that is out of our
                    control as programmers.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Concurrency</b> - By leveraging data ownership and type checking, many concurrency errors are
                    flagged by
                    the compiler rather than discovered at runtime.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Sure, Java is known for many criticisms. In fact, I've met some people who hate it, so why should we learn
            Rust when it wouldn't be surprising to say that other programming languages are superior to Java? Well, Java
            isn't entirely bad, just like its rivals, it has its benefits and disadvantages. Rust, on the other, hand
            has been regarded as the most loved programming language on Stack Overflow for many years. It is safe to say
            that Rust is a great language to learn given that Stack Overflow has been the most popular exchange network
            for programmers. Why don't we get it a try?
        </p>
        <h3><b>Installation</b></h3>
        <p>This section wasn't meant to be included, but since installing Rust on my computer took so long, I figured
            I'd share what I did.<br><br><b>Recommended Installation is by using rustup: <br> Since I'm running on
                Windows</b>
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p>I started by downloading the Rust installer in the official site.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Download Visual Studio C++ Build tools. Open and install the “Desktop development with C++” workload.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Open the Rust installer and proceed with the default installation.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Make sure that the path environment variable for all Rust Development related tools that are
                    installed to the “~/.cargo/bin” directory is available in your system’s environment variables. If
                    not,
                    manually type yours in.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>For the GUI, I decided to use Visual Studio Code and installed the “rust-analyzer” extension. Now we
                    can start writing Rust!</p>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h3><b>Concepts</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Rustup</b> - we installed rustup by official recommendation. It is a toolchain multiplexer
                    responsible for installing, managing, and presenting Rust toolchains.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Cargo</b> - it acts as the build system and package manager for Rust. It is a tool used to help
                    download and manage the libraries that our code needs. This is installed automatically by rustup.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Rustc</b>responsible for translating Rust source code to machine language.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Project Ideas</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>Guessing Game</b> - The program will generate an integer between 1 and 100. It will then prompt
                    the
                    user to enter a number and then the program will indicate how close the guess is to the generated
                    number.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><b>Guessing Game (Enhanced)</b>Works the same as the former but now the program will account the
                    user's total number of correct guesses over the number of games they played.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Findings</b></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>Variables are immutable by default for improved safety and better caching. Add mut keyword to the
                    variable name to make it mutable.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Rust can specify the working space of the data types that you use. Let say I made a variable named
                    "integer" by using the statement "let integer = 12", Rust will assume that it's a data type of
                    i32(an integer with 32 bit of working space), we can specify this by using a semi-colon right after
                    the variable name and specify the data type as follows "let integer: i64 = 32" giving this data type
                    a 64 bit working space.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>In Rust, you can create types that represents data which may be one of a few different variants
                    within the list. Let say, you want to make an integer that can only be between 1 to 10. You can use
                    of enums. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It has an organized library for errors. (https://doc.rust-lang.org/error_codes/error-index.html)</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>It has a peculiar way of making objects. An object requires a struct (a fixed set of data in a
                    single unit) body and an impl (responsible for defining methods of a struct) block. See Line 1-29.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Printing variables or methods inside a string is made easier compared to Java where we have to
                    concatenate them with each other. See line 36.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>The language comes with a standard library and using a crate can get us more functionality into our
                    code. They're basically external packages in Rust.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>This language is a pain in the butt. I frequently get compile errors because of the compiler’s
                    design. Although unpleasant, it's a good thing.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3><b>Source Code</b></h3>
        <p>Please be aware that I did not bother handling errors as I focused more on its functionality.</p>

        <p>With all the basics jot down, I can start working on more complex projects such as file handling, connecting
            to a database and/or creating a simple web application. *Cough* I haven't really got all the fundamentals,
            but I'll manage. Given how strict the language is, I expect to have an easier time than using Java.</p>
